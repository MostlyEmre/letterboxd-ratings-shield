# Letterboxd Ratings Shield

Whenever I'm hunting for new films for my watchlist, I've noticed that low ratings can often prevent me from adding a filmâ€”even when the movie looks interesting.

Or when it's time to rate a film I've just watched, seeing the ratings beforehand can subtly influence my opinion and make me second-guess my rating.

To solve this, I created a script that hides the ratings block on a film's page. The ratings stay hidden unless the movie is marked as watched or reviewed, allowing you to form your own opinions without external influence.

Here's the script: https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/503787-letterboxd-ratings-shield
